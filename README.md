## Detect Breaking Change GitHub Action

This GitHub action is used in your CI pipeline to detect breaking changes in an Open API Specification. It will compare the file in the current branch against the file in the main branch. 

**This is intended to be used as an action triggered on a pull request**

## Usage

```yaml
uses: allenheltondev/detect-breaking-changes-action@v1
with:
  specFilename: spec/openapi.yaml
  accessToken: <PAT from GitHub>
  format: yaml
  breakingChangeTypes: |
    removed-paths
    schema-properties-removed
    parameters-removed
```

Or minimally

```yaml
uses: allenheltondev/detect-breaking-changes-action@v1
with:
  specFilename: oas.json
  accessToken: <PAT from GitHub>
```

*NOTE - It is recommended to keep your Personal Access Token as a secret in your repository*

### Inputs

* `specFilename` - *Required* - Relative path to the Open API Spec from the root
* `accessToken` - *Required* - GitHub Personal Access Token used to load the spec from the main branch
* `format` - Specifies the format of the Open API Spec. Accepts *yaml* or *json*. Defaults to *json* if no value is provided
* `breakingChangeTypes` - List of breaking change types to detect. If none are provided, the entire set will be used.
